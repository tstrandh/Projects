            "source": "### Introduction / Business Problem: \nA Toronto-based beer brewery recently started bottling its beer. Instead of using a distributor to sell and deliver beer to stores in Toronto, the brewery decided to distribute its beer independently. Since the brewery is young, the owner decided only to distribute to on-premise accounts (places where beer is sold and consumed \"on-premise\", which includes bars, clubs, and restaurants, as opposed to grocery and convenience stores which are \"off-premise\" accounts). The brewery is also constrained by owning only one delivery truck which is not refrigerated. In order to maintain a quality product, the owner does not want to distrubute further than 10 miles from the brewery in an unrefrigerated truck. \n\nThe owner does not have any confirmed accounts yet, but he wants to understand what a delivery route would look like if he has the capacity to supply 50 stores within a 10 mile radius of brewery with one delivery per week. The owner wants to filter this projected route based on the most popular 50 on-premise stores within the search area. The end product will be a map with 50 store points segmented into clusters and color-coded by delivery day of the week (Monday through Friday). \n\nThe target audience for this data is business owners, distributors, and sales representatives who want to optimize their route selection for sales and delivery of their products. Routes can be filtered and refined in numerous ways to meet the needs of the specific customer. In this case a brewery owner is trying to understand distribution routes for his product with a limited delivery capacity.  \n\n### Data Methodology\nThe data I will need for this project will come from Foursquare API. I will filter search results by the following criteria: within 10 miles of the brewery; only include \"bars\", \"resturants\", and \"clubs\"; and pick the 50 most popular stores amongst those. Once the data points have been collected, I will segment the stores into 5 geographic clusters, one for each day of the week (Monday through Friday). The clusters will define the separate routes for the one delivery truck each day (the stores only receive one delivery per week). \n\nWhile the data is based on a maximum location search radius, it is also defined by popular restaurants within the search area. This may result in data points are that not even spread across the search area. This is okay, as the intent is to sell the product to the most popular places, not evenly across the the 10 miles. An example of a single day route would be a color-coded cluster of 10 stores in a 5 blocks area of downtown Toronto. A second cluster may be two blocks area or it could be one mile away in a separate neighborhood. \n\nThe method for clustering the data points and displaying them on a map, color-coded by delivery day of the week, will follow the functions we have already practiced in this course.
